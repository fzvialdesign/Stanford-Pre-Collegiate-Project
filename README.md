# Stanford-Pre-Collegiate-Project
Python-based small game-demo for a concept designed and programmed with three other group members at the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies game design and development summer program.

This project was conducted over most of the three-week program described above, which took place the Summer of 2019. The game is a short five-minute demo for a point-and-click murder-mystery game where the player has to collect clues in a variety of areas to piece together a crime scene. We all contributed to coding, and I took a particular focus on the design and narrative aspects of the game demo.
